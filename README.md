# Rust energy project
This project demonstrates a Rust-based implementation of various energy systems and fuels. It models different types of fuels, energy containers, and energy providers (like nuclear reactors and internal combustion engines) using Rust traits and generics. It inc
The project includes a series of tests that validate the functionality of these energy models.
